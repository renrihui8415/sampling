| Sample size     | 50,000 | Pre-election survey: 37,822; Post-election survey: 10,337 | Specific to the study, usually indicated in the paper                                        |
| Target population | Canadian residents, aged 15 and over living in private households, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut and full time residents of institutions         | Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aged 18 or older    | Glossophaga soricina bats in specific regions                                                |

| Survey mode(s)  | Electronic questionnaire or CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing) | Online survey | Field observations and experiments                                                         |
| Timeline        | Every 5 years, from September to December | Campaign Period Survey: September 13th to October 21st, 2019; Post-election survey: October 24th to November 11th, 2019 | Duration of field study, specific to the research                                           |
| Response rate   | 41.9% | Less than 50% | Not applicable in the traditional survey sense                                              |
| Weights         | 1. Basic Weight (WGHT_PER): used for calculating estimates at the individual level; 2. Adjusted Weight: The basic weight is multiplied by a factor to adjust for the proportion of non-volunteers; 3. Adjusted Weight (Income Distribution Adjustment): to ensure that the income distribution matches the 2017 CIS distribution by province; 4. Bootstrap Weights: created using the bootstrap method to estimate sampling error and variance; 5. Non-Response Adjustment Weight: to account for nonresponse, using administrative source data to model and correct for nonresponse bias. | Weight variables are provided; weights must be used to ensure that the data is representative of the population. | Not applicable                                                                               |
| Data processing |  Utilized SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities to ensure high-quality outputs| Not mentioned in the documentation | Detailed methods of observation and analysis                                               |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc. | 1. Imputation Method: Donor Records and Mean Imputation; 2. Imputation steps: personal and family income, formal/informal volunteering variables in the master file, variables in the donation file and the solicitation methods in the master file; 3. Missing income data were obtained by linking to tax data (T1FF) | Incomplete responses, duplicate responses of previous respondents, speeders, those who ‚Äústraight-lined‚Äù grid questions (‚Äústraightliners‚Äù), and respondents whose postal code didn‚Äôt match their province have all been removed from the data file, and are excluded from numbers reported in the documentation. | Cleaning methods and data treatment described                                              |
| Sources of error | Sampling Error; Non-sampling Error (including Coverage Error, Non-response, response errors and processing errors) | Not mentioned in the documentation | Observation error, environmental variability                                                |
| Limitations, known biases | Non-response bias         | Not mentioned in the documentation  | Specific to study conditions and methods                                                     |
