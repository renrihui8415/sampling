| Sample type     | Stratified sampling, combined with random sampling and reject sampling | Representative sample of Canadian voters | Sample of Glossophaga soricina bats                                                         |

| Sampling frame  | A frame that combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame | Lists of registered voters or electoral rolls | Locations where Glossophaga soricina bats are found                                         |
| Survey mode(s)  | Electronic questionnaire or CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing) | Online survey administered via web platforms | Field observations and experiments                                                         |
| Timeline        | Every 5 years, from September to December | Conducted around federal election periods | Duration of field study, specific to the research                                           |
| Response rate   | 41.9% | Reported in survey findings, varying by cycle | Not applicable in the traditional survey sense                                              |
| Weights         | 1. Basic Weight (WGHT_PER): used for calculating estimates at the individual level; 2. Adjusted Weight: The basic weight is multiplied by a factor to adjust for the proportion of non-volunteers; 3. Adjusted Weight (Income Distribution Adjustment): to ensure that the income distribution matches the 2017 CIS distribution by province; 4. Bootstrap Weights: created using the bootstrap method to estimate sampling error and variance; 5. Non-Response Adjustment Weight: to account for nonresponse, using administrative source data to model and correct for nonresponse bias. | Applied to adjust for sampling biases and non-response | Not applicable                                                                               |
| Data processing |  Utilized SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities to ensure high-quality outputs| Detailed methods documented in survey reports | Detailed methods of observation and analysis                                               |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc. | 1. Imputation Method: Donor Records and Mean Imputation; 2. Imputation steps: personal and family income, formal/informal volunteering variables in the master file, variables in the donation file and the solicitation methods in the master file; 3. Missing income data were obtained by linking to tax data (T1FF) | Procedures documented to ensure data quality | Cleaning methods and data treatment described                                              |
| Sources of error | Sampling Error; Non-sampling Error (including Coverage Error, Non-response, response errors and processing errors) | Sampling error, non-response bias, methodological biases | Observation error, environmental variability                                                |
| Limitations, known biases | Non-response bias         | Typically discussed in survey analysis  | Specific to study conditions and methods                                                     |
