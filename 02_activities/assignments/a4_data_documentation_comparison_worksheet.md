|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sample type     | Stratified sampling, combined with random sampling and reject sampling | Stratified sampling and quota sampling | Convenience sampling                                                       |
| Sample size     | 50,000 | Pre-election survey: 37,822; Post-election survey: 10,337 | 1. Dietary AnalysisÔºö 38 fecal samples from 112 G. soricina caught by mist nets in the Area de Conservaci√≥n de Guanacaste, Costa Rica; 2. Behavioural Experiments: 23 synchronized video and call sessions of 5 males and 10 females of G. soricina from a captive colony at the University of Bristol; 3. Model of Maximum Detection Distances: echolocation call intensity from  7 free-flying G. soricina and moths surface area measurements                                     |
| Target population | Canadian residents, aged 15 and over living in private households, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut and full time residents of institutions         | Canadian citizens and permanent residents, aged 18 or older    | The Neotropical bat Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766)                                                |

| Survey mode(s)  | Electronic questionnaire or CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing) | Online survey | Field observations and experiments                                                         |
| Timeline        | Every 5 years, from September to December | Campaign Period Survey: September 13th to October 21st, 2019; Post-election survey: October 24th to November 11th, 2019 | 1. Dietary Analysis: 7-week period from late May to early July 2009; 2. Behavioural Experiments: D1‚Äì1¬∑5 h on nine consecutive days; 3. Model of Maximum Detection Distances: 7 individual bats flying for up to 2.5 hours                                          |
| Response rate   | 41.9% | Less than 50% | Not applicable in the traditional survey sense                                              |
| Weights         | 1. Basic Weight (WGHT_PER): used for calculating estimates at the individual level; 2. Adjusted Weight: The basic weight is multiplied by a factor to adjust for the proportion of non-volunteers; 3. Adjusted Weight (Income Distribution Adjustment): to ensure that the income distribution matches the 2017 CIS distribution by province; 4. Bootstrap Weights: created using the bootstrap method to estimate sampling error and variance; 5. Non-Response Adjustment Weight: to account for nonresponse, using administrative source data to model and correct for nonresponse bias. | Weight variables are provided; weights must be used to ensure that the data is representative of the population. | Not applicable                                                                               |
| Data processing |  Utilized SSPE set of generalized processing steps and utilities to ensure high-quality outputs| Not mentioned in the documentation | Calculate the average maximum detection distance of the bat and estimate the upper and lower limits of the detection distance using the standard errors of source level, peak frequency, call duration, and target strength                                               |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc. | 1. Imputation Method: Donor Records and Mean Imputation; 2. Imputation steps: personal and family income, formal/informal volunteering variables in the master file, variables in the donation file and the solicitation methods in the master file; 3. Missing income data were obtained by linking to tax data (T1FF) | Incomplete responses, duplicate responses of previous respondents, speeders, those who ‚Äústraight-lined‚Äù grid questions (‚Äústraightliners‚Äù), and respondents whose postal code didn‚Äôt match their province have all been removed from the data file, and are excluded from numbers reported in the documentation. | Not mentioned in the documentation                                             |
| Sources of error | Sampling Error; Non-sampling Error (including Coverage Error, Non-response, response errors and processing errors) | Not mentioned in the documentation | Observation error, environmental variability                                                |
| Limitations, known biases | Non-response bias         | Not mentioned in the documentation  | When building the Model of Maximum Detection Distances: 1. Model Bias: Using the lowest hearing thresholds for moths may bias the model in favor of moths; 2. Threshold Bias: Using the low hearing threshold of Noctua pronuba may lead to overestimation of detection distances for moths; 3. Duration Correction Bias: Adjusting hearing thresholds for shorter call durations may further bias the model towards moths.                                                     |
