# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```

    I expect the sample to reasonably represent the target population. Using stratified sampling helps ensure various demographic groups and geographic regions are adequately included, crucial for capturing diverse voter opinions across Canada. However, achieving perfect representativeness is challenging, especially with just one month remaining before the election. Here are several potential errors:

        - Selection Bias: If the survey mainly collects responses from urban areas with high internet access, it might overlook rural voters less reliant on online platforms.

        - Coverage Error: Conducting the survey only in major cities could miss opinions from smaller towns and rural areas, giving an incomplete national perspective.

        - Measurement Error: Ambiguous survey questions, like those about "job opportunities," may lead to different interpretations among respondents, affecting accuracy on economic issues.

        - Non-Response: If younger voters are less likely to respond to survey invitations, the results may not fully reflect their views on education and job prospects, potentially biasing overall findings.
        
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    
    Based on the class content, I would like to make a refinement to Question 6 in the original survey to improve clarity and data quality:

    Original Question 6: What changes or improvements would you like to see from the government in the next four years? (Open-ended)

    Revised Question 6: What specific policies or actions would you prioritize for the government to address in the next four years? Please list up to three main priorities.

    Reasoning: This revision provides clearer guidance to respondents, ensuring more focused and actionable responses. It helps avoid vague or broad answers, thereby improving the usefulness of the collected data for policy planning and analysis.

    I have updated the original survey accordingly. [Survey Link](https://github.com/renrihui8415/sampling/blob/questionnaire-a/02_activities/assignments/a2_questionnaire_design_part_a.md).

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    
    No, using an observational study would not be suitable for understanding voter preferences and priorities before a federal election. Observational studies are better suited for studying behaviors and relationships in natural settings without intervention. For understanding voter preferences, attitudes, and priorities, surveys provide direct interaction that allows for precise questioning and structured data collection. This approach is essential for political campaign planning and strategy development.

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
